                <p><strong>1. <span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-info-circle"></span> [General] Forking vs Branching for group projects</strong></p>
              </template>
              <p>As NUS SoC students, we all have to do many group projects, most of which involve collaborating on code. I've used GitHub in the past for this, but mostly in the very simple &quot;everyone just commits to master&quot; style. Of course, with CS2113T, we're all now more familiar with advanced git and revision control strategies.</p>
              <p>Prof, can I ask, in your opinion, for the type of small group project that we often undertake, what's the best approach of these:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Creating a GitHub Organisation for the project and creating a repository under the organisation that everyone contributes to via forks and PRs.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>One member making a repository on their account and everyone making a fork and submitting PRs.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>One member making a repository on their account and everyone making a separate branch and submitting PRs.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>One member making a repository on their account and everyone committing to a separate &quot;development&quot; branch, and then submitting PRs to master.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Committing directly to master.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>While PRs are very good for organising code, I think they can be a bit of a hassle for smaller projects where speed is more important than code quality (as long as there are no bugs, which should be tested before committing). I wonder if Prof has any advice on choosing an approach? Or maybe any of my classmates have any ideas/stories/suggestions?</p>
              <p>Thank you all in advance, have a lovely weekend!

              </template>
              <p>Hi Prof and everyone,</p>
              <p>I was looking through the RepoSense dashboard with all of our iPs, and I noticed that my iP is quite behind (the last commit was on 4th September). However, I have made more commits to my iP since then (including on the same day) but those don't seem to be picked up by RepoSense. I noticed others' commits as new as today are being picked up; is there something I'm doing wrong? Have I perhaps messed up a branch or something?</p>
              <p>Thank you!</p>

For example, I have a package called &quot;task&quot; with some different classes, all of which are accessed by my main Duke class in another package.

              <p>Can I clarify when we are expected to use the &quot;this&quot; keyword to access member variables in a class? Personally, I prefer to use &quot;this&quot; at all times to be explicit, but I seem to remember being told (either in lecture or in tutorial, can't seem to recall which) not to use it when not required to cut down on clutter. I couldn't find anything on this in the Java coding standard guide. The notes on the website on the use of the &quot;this&quot; keyword don't cover this either.</p>

              </template>
              <p><a href="https://nus-cs2113-ay2021s1.github.io/website/schedule/week3/topics.html#key-exercise-pass-objects-to-move-method">https://nus-cs2113-ay2021s1.github.io/website/schedule/week3/topics.html#key-exercise-pass-objects-to-move-method</a></p>
              <p>The instructions for creating the move method specifies the following behaviour:</p>
              <blockquote>
                <ul>
                  <li>Returns null and does nothing if either p or r is null</li>
                </ul>
              </blockquote>
              <blockquote>
                <ul>
                  <li>Returns a new Point object that has attributes x and y that match those of r</li>
                </ul>
              </blockquote>
              <blockquote>
                <ul>
                  <li>Does not modify p</li>
                </ul>
              </blockquote>
              <blockquote>
                <ul>
                  <li>Updates r so that its attributes x and y match those of p</li>
                </ul>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I think the instructions do not make clear whether the returned Point object should have attributes x and y matching those of r before the modification or after.</p>
              <p>The expected output seems to indicate that it is the former; that is, the method returns the previous/initial position of the rectangle as a Point. There's also little point (no pun intended) in directly returning one of the parameters.</p>
              <p>Perhaps the written instructions could be made slightly more explicit in mentioning this?

                <p><strong>7. <span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-info-circle"></span> [Week 3 Ex2] Using Accessors/Getters vs directly accessing member variables</strong></p>
              </template>
              <p>Hi Prof,</p>
              <p>Week 3 Ex2 on <a href="http://repl.it">repl.it</a> requires us to calculate the area of a rectangle object, by multiplying its height and width together. Is it recommended to use the getter methods for the dimensions of the rectangle, or to just directly access the height and width variables? I noticed the model solution used the latter approach, but I used the getter methods myself.</p>
              <p>The comments in the skeleton code suggest using the setter for changing the dimensions rather than directly modifying the member variables, so I'm wondering why the model solution accessed the member variables directly rather than using the getters.</p>
              <p>Thank you, have a great day!

              </template>
              <p>I hear a lot of my friends having issues with installing Java - specifically, the part about getting it to show up in their PATH as expected - so I thought I'd share what worked for me.</p>
              <p>I installed OpenJDK using the AdoptOpenJDK installer, linked <a href="https://adoptopenjdk.net/">here</a>. I chose OpenJDK 11 and Hotspot JVM.</p>
              <p>Simply downloading and running the installer should, in theory, configure everything as necessary. By default, the installer will add the JDK to the PATH, so you should not need to perform any additional setup, except configuring your IDE (IntelliJ IDEA or whatever you might be using) to use the appropriate JDK.</p>
              <p>Has anyone else had success using this particular installer?

              <p>@wangqinNick Ahhh I think I see the problem then. Thank you. I also just double checked that all my tags were pushed because some of my tags this morning were only on my local repo 😕 I was just very confused since no one else seemed to have this issue; perhaps they already merged their branches.</p>
              <p>@okkhoy The <a href="http://user.name">user.name</a> seems to be fine. I'll wait for the reposense to update tomorrow.</p>
              <p>Thank you to everyone 😃

              <p>Thank you for the helpful insight. When you say PR workflow, are there any significant advantages or disadvantages to creating forks vs. branches? I imagine forks keep the production repository cleaner, but branches are a bit easier to manage?

              <p>Interesting update: If I use IntelliJ to automatically import each class (i.e. delete my import com.neilbaner.duke.exceptions.* and then Alt-Enter on each exception manually), then by the time I import every single exception (eg. import com.neilbaner.duke.exceptions.TaskIndexOutOfBoundsException, com.neilbaner.duke.exceptions.UnknownCommandException etc. etc, IntelliJ decides that it should combine them all back into com.neilbaner.duke.exceptions.*. This does throw a bit of a spanner in the works.

              <p>I, too, am facing something similar. The same path that works in IntelliJ no longer works when I create a JAR and test it using<code v-pre>java -jar</code>. I handled the exception, but the feature doesn't work as expected which is a bit of a shame.

              <p>For mine, there are some text files containing lists of application data (i.e. not user generated data) that I want to bundle with the application. I made sure that those text files are inside the jar, but the same path that works when running in IntelliJ don't work with the jar. Can I ask how we can access files within the jar? Should the path be something like ./ip.jar/... ?

              <p>I was using the IntelliJ IDEA version 2019.2 on a macOS 10.15. After updating the the IDEA to version 2020.3, it could not recognise some of my third-party libraries. I tried several methods and still could not solve the issue, including manually set up the jar path and etc. The IDEA also crashed several times when I set the library path. In the end, I had to reinstall the 2019.2 version.

              <p>The responseSense does not detect branch unless it has been merged to master and pushed to the remote. You just merge your level-five one hour ago and I think you can check the progress tomorrow.</p>
              <p>And similar for the tags, it might be that your tag for the levels does not point to commits in the main branch. Try checking if all the commits of the relevant tags can be found on your main branch. Tag the merging commits, instead of the branch commit.

              <p>This is interesting. I am not sure why it treats the parameter as the jar file name. The command works on my laptop. Could you try without the .\before the jar name?

              <p>Then maybe because your output is not in UTF-8? You can try force the print a tick in UTF-8 and see if there is a tick at cmd to check if it is the problem.

              <p>While working on the increment, I find an issue when using file compare ('FC') for the special characters '✓' and '✘'. In the output file 'ACTUAL.TXT', the corresponding characters seem to get converted to '?' (question mark), and the follow lines will be shown in the diff:</p>

              <p>'''</p>
              <p>To fix it, I basically had to change the the expected character to be a '?' in 'EXPECTED.TXT' and it will give me that no differences were encountered. However, this would mean that the test cannot check for '✓' and '✘' characters being different.</p>
              <p>I guess that the error probably comes from the special characters being unicode characters which is an issue if 'FC' isn't expecting it. From the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/fc">docs</a>, there is an option for unicode, but it will be on the whole file and not just a single character.</p>
              <p>I also note that in <a href="https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/textUiTesting.html#updating-tests-as-the-program-evolves">Updating test as the program evolves</a>, &quot;we accept that the actual behavior should be the new expected behavior&quot;.</p>
              <p>Is there any way for the test to check for those characters, or should I just stick with the question marks?

              <p>Hey, i think perhaps this will work:</p>
              <p><code v-pre>java -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -classpath ..\bin main\java\Duke &lt; input.txt &gt; ACTUAL.TXT</code></p>
              <p>It seems that because your compilation destination is <root>\bin but the package main.java was compiled and not the files, the classpath is ..\bin but you need to execute the <code v-pre>&lt;package&gt;.&lt;subpackage&gt;.&lt;main class&gt;</code>.</root>

              <p>If this still doesn't work, try changing your javac command in runtest.bat to:</p>
              <p><code v-pre>javac -verbose -cp ..\src\main\java -Xlint:none -d ..\bin ..\src\main\java\*.java</code></p>
              <p>to see what files or packages are being loaded.

              <p>I personally feel using explicit imports is still better; on top of the stated benefits, I feel it is also more flexible in that it allows you to more clearly and easily remove particular import statements in the event you reorganize your packages and/or the code in the class to which you are importing the packages/classes to.

              <p>Honestly think this should be perfectly sound and acceptable, although it isn't exactly specified in most places I've looked (including all the <a href="https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/java/basic.html#references">reference links at the bottom of the SE-EDU Java coding standard page</a>).</p>
              <p>The alternative to indexing your array would be to write something like <code v-pre>int nameIndex = 0; int dateIndex = 1</code> which for a 2-element array feels like it actually makes the code a little less readable.</p>
              <p>A <em>possibly</em> relevant section I found is in <a href="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconventions-150003.pdf">this doc</a> under section 10.3, but no explicit mention of array indexing.</p>
              <p>Agree this is not so clear cut, so would also like to see what the general recommendation is.

              <p>im not entirely sure if im right, but you can either create another branch and called it that, followed by a merge, or do a git reset back to your previous commit, and merge again.

              <p>Hi, I was unable to complete all the steps during the lecture for the circus activity, so I attempted them again. However, I made the mistake of deleting my previous forked repository on Github as I thought it was interfering with my unsuccessful pushes. Currently, the main branch has been updated and hence I was unable to make another branch called &quot;in-lecture&quot;. May I know how I should go about solving this issue?</p>

                <p><strong>2. <span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-info-circle"></span> Question regarding traditional task method for Level-4</strong></p>
              </template>
              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>I was wondering whether we are supposed to retain the traditional task entry feature (e.g. type anything, added as task) as we code Level-4. This seems redundant since the old task method seems to be identical to &quot;ToDo&quot; tasks now.</p>
              <p>Also, may I ask how strictly should we stick to the example outputs? It seems possible to detect the types of tasks automatically by looking for the &quot;by&quot; and &quot;at&quot; keywords in the string itself, but I'm not sure if such implementation/deviation from example output is allowed. (This method will follow the input of Level-2/Level-3)</p>
              <p>Thanks for any advice regarding these queries.

              <p>@okkhoy Thanks for the clarification.</p>
              <p>Regarding the second part, I meant to write the program such that it automatically categorizes the type of task by detecting &quot;/at&quot; and &quot;/by&quot; (or the lack thereof) on the input so that the user does not need to enter specifically the type of task(e.g. typing <code v-pre>project meeting /at Mon 2-4pm</code> instead of <code v-pre>event project meeting /at Mon 2-4pm</code>). However, since the Level-2 commands are retained, I am uncertain of how the automated categorization can distinguish (or is required to distinguish) between a Level-2 &quot;task&quot; and To-Do since they seem like the same thing. Is it a better idea to stick with the guidelines provided by the sample output?

              <p>@okkhoy Thank you for the advice. I will stick with the recommended method for Level-4 and will instead consider implementing automatic flag detection for the tP.

              <p>Apologies for the delayed reply. I just realized my issue is the result of my blunder of forking @okkhoy 's Circus fork instead of the one at <code v-pre>https://github.com/nus-cs2113-AY2021S1/circus</code>. I have since re-done the activity with the correct fork and everything seems to work now.</p>
              <p>Appreciate the help provided.</p>
              <p>@okkhoy</p>
              <p>I was mistaken that the <code v-pre>https://github.com/nus-cs2113-AY2021S1/circus</code> project (I probably shouldn't have called that the 'main branch') had been updated with an <code v-pre>in-lecture</code> branch when in actual fact I accidentally forked your fork instead. Apologies for the inconvenience caused.

              <p>I see, thanks for the reply. I opened up and noticed that my &quot;First Name&quot; on <a href="http://repl.it">repl.it</a> was my real name instead of GitHub name. I hadn't considered that an issue as my <a href="http://repl.it">repl.it</a> username was the same as github.</p>

              </template>
              <p>Hi, I was merging branch-Level-6 to master branch but did not check the &quot;Create a new commit even if fast forward is possible&quot;. It resulted in something like this:</p>
              <p><a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37478363/93120936-ad69c800-f6f6-11ea-89be-e2a3dfa6ee6e.png" target="_self"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37478363/93120936-ad69c800-f6f6-11ea-89be-e2a3dfa6ee6e.png" alt class="img-fluid"></a></p>
              <p>Then I did a <strong>git reset --keep branch-Level-6@{1}</strong> but was unable to revert back to the previous state before merging as the branch-Level-6 returned to the 2nd last commit in branch-Level-6 and master stayed at my last commit of branch-Level-6. So I merged master back into branch-Level-6 which went back into the situation shown in the picture above. I was unable to revert the merge after that.</p>
              <p>How do I move master back to origin/master? Would it be safe to checkout origin/master and reset master branch there? Or may I know if there is any other solution to this?</p>

              <p>As shown on this image, the <a href="http://runtest.sh">runtest.sh</a> prompts &quot;line 14: dos2unix: command not found\r\n1,10c1,10&quot; when executed (I did not modify that file). As a result, my pull request for tp is blocked and cannot get processed.</p>
              <p>On my own computer this problem never occurred and I cannot reproduce it on my computer. It only occurs online when I push the code to the pull request (then the automatic checks starts).</p>
              <p>Need urgent fix.

              <p>My code is printing exactly the same thing (a same string consisting of ansi escape codes) without the use of user input, so there shouldnt be a difference. Also, I cannot reproduce the error on my pc (always no difference) and I have no idea of what I could do to reproduce it.</p>
              <p>also, I'm wondering why it shows dos2unix command not found instead of showing me my output is unexpected.</p>
              <p>I will check my code later but I don't know what I can do about it. it is already printing the same string anyways...

              <blockquote>
                <p>I think perhaps it is because you use the ArrayList, but you did not declare the generic.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <blockquote>
                <p>Since generic does not do type-check and you did not declare either, it gave such warning.</p>

                <p>Try ArrayList &lt; String &gt; filteredList = new ArrayList &lt;&gt;();</p>

              <p>That works, thank you! It seems both warnings are caused because of it.

              <p>I faced the same issue and after implementing @wangqinNick solution, the terminal will still show '''Γ£ÿ''' and '''Γ£ô''' instead of '''✘''' and '''✓''' when I have yet to change the '''EXPECTED.txt''' to match '''ACTUAL.txt'''. But when I open '''ACTUAL.txt''' it shows '''✘''' and '''✓''' correctly.</p>
              <p>After I changed '''EXPECTED.txt''' to match '''ACTUAL.txt''', no differences will be detected when I run runtest.bat so I believe it is the terminal that is not able to show the correct symbol rather than java.</p>
              <p>'''</p>

              <p>Hi there!</p>
              <p>How does your file structure look like in the project?</p>
              <p><a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60383990/91886910-9c639480-ecbc-11ea-8b07-f4480383a7aa.png" target="_self"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60383990/91886910-9c639480-ecbc-11ea-8b07-f4480383a7aa.png" alt class="img-fluid"></a></p>
              <p>If yours looks like this where you have a main.java folder with all the classes inside it, you may need to change the runtest.bat file:</p>
              <p>instead of writing:</p>
              <p><code v-pre>java -classpath ..\bin Duke &lt; input.txt &gt; ACTUAL.TXT</code></p>
              <p>you will need to write:</p>
              <p><code v-pre>java -classpath ..\bin main.java.Duke &lt; input.txt &gt; ACTUAL.TXT</code></p>
              <p>Im not sure if this will help, but it did help me resolve the issue of missing classes. Do let me know how it goes

              <p>Hi Prof, for IP level-3 (mark as done), do we have to account for the cases where the user inputs a task number(positive or negative) that does not exist or if the user simply inputs done with no number and print out an error message?</p>

              <p>I have made my first commit to the forked project, with a summary &quot;Update Level-0&quot;, but I didn't see any change in the dashboard. The last update is still on Mar 03 2020.

              </template>
              <p>For some reasons, I had to rebase my commit history to merge 2 different branches. As a result, the timings for my commits became very recent (ie all the commit timings became that of the time where I did my rebase). Will I be penalised because of my commit timings as they are past the deadlines?
