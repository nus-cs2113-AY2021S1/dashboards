<panel  header="**1. :fas-info-circle: Using * wildcard for imports**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2113-AY2021S1/forum/issues/36" expanded>

Is it ever acceptable to use the * wildcard in an import statement? For example, I have a package called "task" with some different classes, all of which are accessed by my main Duke class in another package. Is it necessary to import every single class separately, or may I use, say, `import com.neilbaner.duke.task.*` ?

Thank you!

<panel  header="**2. :fas-info-circle: Policy on use of this keyword**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2113-AY2021S1/forum/issues/27" expanded>

Can I clarify when we are expected to use the "this" keyword to access member variables in a class? Personally, I prefer to use "this" at all times to be explicit, but I seem to remember being told (either in lecture or in tutorial, can't seem to recall which) not to use it when not required to cut down on clutter. I couldn't find anything on this in the Java coding standard guide. The notes on the website on the use of the "this" keyword don't cover this either. 

I just wanted to confirm if I should always use it or not?

Thank you!

Note that repl.it uses Java version 1.8.0, aka Java 8, NOT Java 11 as we are using for class normally. This may or may not have implications for one of the exercises, due to differences in the String class (eg. Java 11 having some very convenient additions not present in Java 8...)

https://nus-cs2113-ay2021s1.github.io/website/schedule/week3/topics.html#key-exercise-pass-objects-to-move-method

The instructions for creating the move method specifies the following behaviour:

>* Returns null and does nothing if either p or r is null
>* Returns a new Point object that has attributes x and y that match those of r
>* Does not modify p
>* Updates r so that its attributes x and y match those of p

I think the instructions do not make clear whether the returned Point object should have attributes x and y matching those of r before the modification or after. 

The expected output seems to indicate that it is the former; that is, the method returns the previous/initial position of the rectangle as a Point. There's also little point (no pun intended) in directly returning one of the parameters. 

Perhaps the written instructions could be made slightly more explicit in mentioning this?

Hi Prof,

Week 3 Ex2 on repl.it requires us to calculate the area of a rectangle object, by multiplying its height and width together. Is it recommended to use the getter methods for the dimensions of the rectangle, or to just directly access the height and width variables? I noticed the model solution used the latter approach, but I used the getter methods myself. 

The comments in the skeleton code suggest using the setter for changing the dimensions rather than directly modifying the member variables, so I'm wondering why the model solution accessed the member variables directly rather than using the getters. 

Thank you, have a great day!

I hear a lot of my friends having issues with installing Java - specifically, the part about getting it to show up in their PATH as expected - so I thought I'd share what worked for me.

I installed OpenJDK using the AdoptOpenJDK installer, linked [here](https://adoptopenjdk.net/). I chose OpenJDK 11 and Hotspot JVM. 

Simply downloading and running the installer should, in theory, configure everything as necessary. By default, the installer will add the JDK to the PATH, so you should not need to perform any additional setup, except configuring your IDE (IntelliJ IDEA or whatever you might be using) to use the appropriate JDK. 

Has anyone else had success using this particular installer?

OS: Windows 10
Increment: ['A-TextUiTesting'](https://nus-cs2113-ay2021s1.github.io/website/schedule/week4/project.html#a-textuitesting)
File: 'runtest.bat'

While working on the increment, I find an issue when using file compare ('FC') for the special characters 'âœ“' and 'âœ˜'. In the output file 'ACTUAL.TXT', the corresponding characters seem to get converted to '?' (question mark), and the follow lines will be shown in the diff:
'''
Comparing files ACTUAL.TXT and EXPECTED.TXT
***** ACTUAL.TXT
 Got it. I've added this task:
  [D][?] do homework (by: no idea)

------------------------------------------------------------
***** EXPECTED.TXT
 Nice! I've marked this task as done:

------------------------------------------------------------
*****
'''
To fix it, I basically had to change the the expected character to be a '?' in 'EXPECTED.TXT' and it will give me that no differences were encountered. However, this would mean that the test cannot check for 'âœ“' and 'âœ˜' characters being different.

I guess that the error probably comes from the special characters being unicode characters which is an issue if 'FC' isn't expecting it. From the [docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/fc), there is an option for unicode, but it will be on the whole file and not just a single character.

I also note that in [Updating test as the program evolves](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/textUiTesting.html#updating-tests-as-the-program-evolves), "we accept that the actual behavior should be the new expected behavior".

Is there any way for the test to check for those characters, or should I just stick with the question marks?

Other than the given ones regarding 'descriptionPrefix', 'printingDescription()', and 'important', these should be the other ones:

- 'pastDescription' should be 'pastDescriptions' to indicate collection

I think perhaps it is because you use the ArrayList, but you did not declare the generic.

You need to declare and compile all the classes you have, not only the main class.
Like this:

Hey, i think perhaps this will work:

`java -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -classpath ..\bin main\java\Duke < input.txt > ACTUAL.TXT`

It seems that because your compilation destination is <root>\bin but the package main.java was compiled and not the files, the classpath is ..\bin but you need to execute the `<package>.<subpackage>.<main class>`.

If this still doesn't work, try changing your javac command in runtest.bat to:

`javac  -verbose -cp ..\src\main\java -Xlint:none -d ..\bin ..\src\main\java\*.java`

to see what files or packages are being loaded.

I personally feel using explicit imports is still better; on top of the stated benefits, I feel it is also more flexible in that it allows you to more clearly and easily remove particular import statements in the event you reorganize your packages and/or the code in the class to which you are importing the packages/classes to.

I try changing it to:
'''
java -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -classpath ..\bin main\java\Duke < input.txt > ACTUAL.TXT
'''
The same error still comes out. However, when I change it to:
'''
java -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -classpath ../bin main/java/Duke < input.txt > ACTUAL.TXT
'''
It works :D. I then try to change all backslash to slash in the runtime.bat file and it also works. I am not really sure why this works, but could this lead to a problem in the future?

I also had the same problem of a build failure and the terminal being unable to find the classes that I have used in Duke. However, I was testing things out and either of these two compile lines seems to make it work:
javac  -cp ..\src -Xlint:none -d ..\bin ..\src\main\java\Task.java
javac  -cp ..\src -Xlint:none -d ..\bin ..\src\main\java\*.java

Hi,
I was wondering whether we are supposed to retain the traditional task entry feature (e.g. type anything, added as task) as we code Level-4. This seems redundant since the old task method seems to be identical to "ToDo" tasks now.

Also, may I ask how strictly should we stick to the example outputs? It seems possible to detect the types of tasks automatically by looking for the "by" and "at" keywords in the string itself, but I'm not sure if such implementation/deviation from example output is allowed. (This method will follow the input of Level-2/Level-3)

Thanks for any advice regarding these queries.

@okkhoy Thanks for the clarification. 

Regarding the second part, I meant to write the program such that it automatically categorizes the type of task by detecting "/at" and "/by" (or the lack thereof) on the input so that the user does not need to enter specifically the type of task(e.g. typing `project meeting /at Mon 2-4pm` instead of  `event project meeting /at Mon 2-4pm`). However, since the Level-2 commands are retained, I am uncertain of how the automated categorization can distinguish (or is required to distinguish) between a Level-2 "task" and To-Do since they seem like the same thing. Is it a better idea to stick with the guidelines provided by the sample output?

For Level-3 of the iP, can we assume that the input from the user will always be done < int > and no other variations like < int > done/I have done < int >?

Hi Prof, regarding Level-0 of the iP, the task states that we should commit after making changes, for this increment are we supposed to push the changes to the fork on github after committing? In addition, are we supposed to keep the DUKE logo that shows at the start?

I faced the same issue and after implementing @wangqinNick solution, the terminal will still show '''Î“Â£Ã¿''' and '''Î“Â£Ã´''' instead of '''âœ˜''' and '''âœ“''' when I have yet to change the '''EXPECTED.txt''' to match '''ACTUAL.txt'''. But when I open '''ACTUAL.txt''' it shows '''âœ˜''' and '''âœ“''' correctly. 
After I changed '''EXPECTED.txt''' to match '''ACTUAL.txt''', no differences will be detected when I run runtest.bat so I believe it is the terminal that is not able to show the correct symbol rather than java.

Hi there!
How does your file structure look like in the project?
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60383990/91886910-9c639480-ecbc-11ea-8b07-f4480383a7aa.png)
If yours looks like this where you have a main.java folder with all the classes inside it, you may need to change the runtest.bat file:

instead of writing:
`java -classpath ..\bin Duke < input.txt > ACTUAL.TXT`
you will need to write:
`java -classpath ..\bin main.java.Duke < input.txt > ACTUAL.TXT`
Im not sure if this will help, but it did help me resolve the issue of missing classes. Do let me know how it goes

For some reasons, I had to rebase my commit history to merge 2 different branches. As a result, the timings for my commits became very recent (ie all the commit timings became that of the time where I did my rebase). Will I be penalised because of my commit timings as they are past the deadlines?
